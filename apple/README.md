### View
```swift
import UIKit
import MediastreamPlatformSDK

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        let playerConfig = MediastreamPlayerConfig()
        let mdstrm = MediastreamPlatformSDK()

        playerConfig.accountID = "ACCOUNT_ID"
        playerConfig.id = "CONTENT_ID"
        playerConfig.type = MediastreamPlayerConfig.VideoTypes.VOD

        self.addChildViewController(mdstrm)
        self.view.addSubview(mdstrm.view)

        mdstrm.setup(playerConfig)
        mdstrm.play()
    }

    override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
        super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
        // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.
    }
}
```
# MediastreamPlayerConfig: Customizing Your Playback Experience

The `MediastreamPlayerConfig` class in the Mediastream iOS|Apple TV SDK provides a range of properties for tailoring and enhancing your playback experience. Here's an overview of the current properties:

## **Required Parameters:**

- **`id` (String):** Video, Audio, Live or Episode ID. You can get it from Mediastream Platform.
- **`accountID` (String):** Account ID. You can get it from Mediastream Platform.
- **`type` (MediastreamPlayerConfig.VideoTypes):** Video type. Possible values: VOD, LIVE, EPISODE. Tells the player what type of content is going to be played.

## **Optional Parameters:**

- **`adUrl` (String):** AdURL (e.g., VAST). If not specified, will play ads configured in the Mediastream Platform.
- **`accessToken` (String):** Access token for restricted videos.
- **`autoplay` (boolean):** Autoplay video if true. Default: false.
- **`videoFormat` (MediastreamPlayerConfig.AudioVideoFormat):** Type of video (e.g., HLS). Possible values: HLS, M4A. Default: HLS.
- **`dvr` (boolean):** Player starts prepared to use DVR. Default: false.
- **`windowDVR` (int):** Window DVR voiced in seconds.
- **`showControls` (boolean):** Hide the controls of the player. Default: true.
- **`referer` (string):** Allows setting a custom referrer for statistics.
- **`src` (string):** Arbitrary source to reproduce.
- **`loadNextAutomatically` (boolean):** Allows playing the next episode if it exists. Available only when the EPISODE type is set. Default: false.
- **`appName` (string):** Very useful to identify traffic in platform analytics. Example: "mediastream-app-tv" or "mediastream-app-mobile".
- **`playerId` (String):** Takes player configuration from platform settings.
- **`tryToGetMetadataFromLiveWhenAudio` (boolean):** If your live content contains TPE1 and TIT2 tags on the manifest, this metadata will be parsed and sent on `onLiveAudioCurrentSongChanged` event. Default: true.
- **`googleImaPPID` (String):** Allows to set PPID (Publisher Provided Identification) to IMA SDK.
- **`googleImaLanguage` (String):** Allows to set language to IMA SDK UI. Default: en.
- **`addAdCustomAttribute`(key <String>, value <String>):** Allows sending custom parameters in an advertising VAST. To make it work, you need to include the *cust.* query in the VAST query strings, followed by the key you want to replace. Example: *&cust.test_ca=*. To replace it, call *config.addAdCustomAttribute("test_ca", "hi")*, which will result in the final URL being: *&cust.test_ca=hi*. (Just works if adurl is comming on the config.)
- **`adTagParameters`([AdRequestParam: String]):** Allows you to set the parameters of the url tag when there is google dai, any field that appears in the enum will be appended or replaced in the original url tag.

# Implementing Event Handling with `MediastreamPlayerCallback`

The `MediastreamPlayerCallback` interface in the Mediastream SDK serves as the contract for handling various player events. By implementing this interface, you can listen to and respond to different states and actions during playback. Here's how you can use it:

```swift
let mdstrm = MediastreamPlatformSDK()

mdstrm.events.listenTo(eventName: "play", action: {
    NSLog("Player is playing")
})

mdstrm.events.listenTo(eventName: "pause", action: {
    NSLog("Player is paused")
})

mdstrm.events.listenTo(eventName: "error", action: { (information: Any?) in
    if (information != nil) {
        if let info = information as? String {
            NSLog("ERROR: \(info)")
        }
    }
})

mdstrm.events.listenTo(eventName: "onDAIAdEvent", action: { (information: Any?) in
    if (information != nil) {
        print("onDAIAdEvent: \(information)")
    }
})
```
# Reminder

MediastreamPlayer is an instance of AVPlayer so it has all its features, it is extendable to other features such as AirPlay Cast, where it is only necessary to generate an instance of the button and add it to the player layer and it will work without problems.

Example of Airplay Button on Custom UI or No Controls Enabled:

```swift
    func CreateAirPlayButton() {
        let airPlayButton = AVRoutePickerView(frame: CGRect(x: 20, y: 50, width: 40, height: 40))
        airPlayButton.activeTintColor = .blue
        airPlayButton.tintColor = .gray
        mainContainer.addSubview(airPlayButton)
    }
```

# Event Listening in Mediastream SDK

The Mediastream SDK allows you to listen to various events emitted by the player, providing valuable hooks into the playback lifecycle. Here are the available events:

1. **`finish:`**
   - Called when the current video has completed playback to the end of the video.

2. **`error:`**
   - Called when an error not related to playback occurs.

3. **`pause:`**
   - Called when the current video pauses playback.

4. **`play:`**
   - Called when the current video starts playing from the beginning.

5. **`ready:`**
   - Called when the current video resumes playing from a paused state.

6. **`onAdPlay:`**
    - Called when an Ad starts to play.

7. **`onAdPause:`**
    - Called when an Ad is paused.

8. **`onAdLoaded:`**
    - Called when an Ad is loaded.

9. **`onAdResume:`**
    - Called when an Ad is in resume mode.

10. **`onAdEnded:`**
    - Called when an Ad finishes.

11. **`onAdError:`**
    - Called when an Ad fails.

12. **`onAdSkipped:`**
    - Called when an Ad is skipped.

13. **`conectionStablished:`**
    - Called whenever the SDK is connected to internet.

14. **`conectionLost:`**
    - Called whenever the SDK lost internet connection.

15. **`seek:`**
    - Called when the user is seeking.
